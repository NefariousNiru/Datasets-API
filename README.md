# Datasets-API
This repository serves as a centralized collection of files containing curated data chunks on various topics such as job titles, recipes, and more. Whether you're looking to build applications, conduct analysis, or simply explore interesting datasets, this repository provides accessible and organized data for public use. Feel free to raise a PR to add to the datasets. 

I have included JSON and SQL dumps for the files. A few might have both while others have either.
